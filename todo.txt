- chord identification algorithm (on it)
    - alt chords

- interval : from step to name "minor second", "perfect fifth", etc.

- another toFormula but with formula taking always the root as reference.

    - creation of chord objects and similar must accept variable arguments as input

- "deconstructor" iterates through all permutations of different sizes (max the original size), to see what chords are 
    inside a collection of notesg

- constants like formula object names to upper case

- scale notation fixer: use sharp and flats correctly in a scale

- option to change sharps to flats and the other way around

- sharp to standard mode (flat) transformer to deal internally only with flats

- implement valueOf and toString to all your classes and objects
