= IMPORTANT: should the inversions be handled in the recognition algorithm, or stored as formulas?

- chord identification algorithm (on it)

- interval : from step to name "minor second", "perfect fifth", etc.

- another toFormula but with formula taking always the root as reference.

- chord possibilities: name all the chords that can be done with a set of notes that are not in order

- chord identification: iterate through all permutations, insead of only inversions?

- datatype that ties formula number with note name for chord recognition
    
- in unit test: use custom equality function rather than stringify

- creation of chord objects and similar must accept variable arguments as input

- "deconstructor" iterates through all permutations of different sizes (max the original size), to see what chords are 
    inside a collection of notesg

- constants like formula object names to upper case
