= IMPORTANT: should the inversions be handled in the recognition algorithm, or stored as formulas?

- toFormula in process that can handle arrays of string

- chord identification algorithm (on it)

- interval : from step to name "minor second", "perfect fifth", etc.

- another toFormula but with formula taking always the root as reference.

- chord possibilities: name all the chords that can be done with a set of notes that are not in order

- chord identification: iterate through all permutations, insead of only inversions?

- datatype that ties formula number with note name for chord recognition
    
- in unit test: use custom equality function rather than stringify
